YetAnotherAutoMounter is a simple automounter for linux systems. The key ideia is keep it simple and fast.

It was designed firstly to use pcmanfm and zenity, but I want to change it in a closer future and make it suitable for
user needs (through a cfg file maybe???).

What does it support?
 -FAT file systems;
 -NTFS file systems;
 -EXT* file systems;
 
What's peding?
 -Add more file system types to be supported by;
 -Improve child proccess handling (due to a short deadline it's creating some zombie proccess);
 -Create notification windows using gtk+ to make it kind of stand-alone and not zenity-dependent;
 -Configuration file to let user decide wich File Manager he wants to use for opening the mountpoint folder;
 
If you have any bug to relate, any patch to send or will to help me on this development please send email to:
